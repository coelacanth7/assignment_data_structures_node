This repository is practice for learning about ways of sorting data in memory

Gregory Alford

1. Accessing an item by index in an array

O(1)

By having the array index, we only need simple math to find the item in any part of the array

2. Unshifting a new item into the beginning of an array

O(n)

A new array has to be created

3. Pushing an item onto the end of an array

O(n)

A new array has to be created

4. Upcasing a String

O(n)

string is arrray like object, updating items in an array is fast up we have to update all the items each individually

5. Reversing a String

O(n)

Make a new array with all the elements of the old one.

6. Finding the max of an array

O(1)

and arrays length is already locked so you can look for the last index in memory where you think it will be

splitting a String

O(1)

The data stays the same

Inserting a value to an Object

O(1)

Retrieving the keys of an Object ({ foo: "bar" }.keys)

O(n)
